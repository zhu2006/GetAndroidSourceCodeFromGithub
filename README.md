# GetAndroidSourceCodeFromGithub
provide a  way to get android sourceCode from http://android.github.io/,because the repo not 
work when I was try to download with it.I can not fix it.You may want to check http://android.github.io/ 
to find another way with repo;

How to use?

getHtmlString.py (tested on pytho2.7) to get the git repo URL on http://android.github.io/;
you need to copy the git URL to the gitBatchDownload.sh now,this is bad idea.
gitBatchDownload.sh will use git to  download it ,later I will rewrite this script.
